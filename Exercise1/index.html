  <h1>Landscape Architecture 458/558 Exercise One</h1>
  <p>I am Rachel Schmitz. I am currently a Design and Environmental Studies Double major with a GIS minor. 
  I just found out about GIS last semester through Bio 370 and I am excited about the applications to design and environmental planning. 
  I am off campus this semester although I do live in Ames, I also work full time and my job requires a full availability. 
  I don't have any experience in coding, but I am very excited to learn as I view it as a useful skill. 
  I have used ArcGIS, taken ESRI courses, ArcMac, and ArcPro although I am a beginner at all of these. 
  I hope to gain a basic knowledge of coding and a more broad background in GIS through design.
  I have also added a recent picture of my boyfriend and myself celebrating our six year annaversary.
